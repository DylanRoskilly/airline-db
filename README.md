# Airline Database Application

Created for my CM12004: Discrete Maths and Databases unit at university and was awarded 83%. 

## Usage

CLI to interact with an SQL database for an airline company with CRUD operations and ability to view summary statistics such as:
- Rank upcoming flights by percentage of used up seats
- Rank a pilot's days of the week based on number of flights
- Get number of flights to a destination per month
- and more...

## Entity Relationship Diagram

Each table in the database has their own class. These classes contain methods which provide an interface to query the SQL database. The classes also provide an effective way to validate inputted data.
